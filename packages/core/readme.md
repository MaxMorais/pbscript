[PBScript](https://github.com/benallfree/pbscript) allows you to write [PocketBase](https://pocketbase.io) server-side functions in Typescript or Javascript without recompiling.

This package is contains the Javascript core functions necessary to bind TS/JS to PocketBase hooks. You must import this:

```ts
import '@pbscript/core'
```
